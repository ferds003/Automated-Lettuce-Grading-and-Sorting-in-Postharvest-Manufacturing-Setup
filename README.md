# Automated-Lettuce-Grading-and-Sorting-in-Postharvest-Manufacturing-Setup-

This project presents an **automated quality grading system** for iceberg lettuce (*Lactuca sativa var. capitata*), integrating **Genetic Programming (GP)** for parameter estimation and **Fuzzy Logic (FL)** for quality classification.  
The system addresses inefficiencies in manual grading, ensuring **objective, consistent, and non-destructive** quality assessment.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- Uses **image-derived features** (RGB & HSV) for analysis.
- Estimates **chlorophyll-a**, **moisture content**, and **fresh head weight** via genetic programming (GP) models.
- Classifies lettuce into **three grades** using a **Mamdani-Type 1 fuzzy logic inference system**:
  - **Grade 1 (High Quality)**  
  - **Grade 2 (Medium Quality)**  
  - **Grade 3 (Low Quality)**
- Achieved **90% classification accuracy** on test samples.

## üìä Methodology

### 1. Image Capturing & Processing
- Lettuce heads were photographed in a **controlled chamber (~400 lux)**.  
- Images were pre-processed in MATLAB, with **data augmentation** (scaling, flipping, rotating) to expand the dataset.  
- Extracted **RGB and HSV mean values**, commonly used in crop ripeness and food quality analysis.

### 2. Parameter Extraction
Three key quality parameters were measured in the laboratory:
- **Chlorophyll-a** ‚Äì extracted using ethanol and quantified with UV-VIS spectrophotometry (663 nm, 645 nm).  
- **Moisture Content** ‚Äì determined via oven-drying at 80¬∞C for 8 hours.  
- **Fresh Head Weight** ‚Äì measured directly with an analytical balance.  

### 3. Genetic Programming (GP) Modeling
- Input: RGB & HSV values  
- Output: Predicted values of chlorophyll-a, moisture content, fresh weight.  
- Models evaluated using **R¬≤, RMSE, MAE, and complexity**.  
- GP1 (RGB-HSV inputs) outperformed GP2 (HSV-only inputs) in predictive accuracy.

### 4. Fuzzy Logic Classification
- Mamdani-Type 1 fuzzy system with **membership functions**:
  - Inputs: chlorophyll-a, moisture content, fresh head weight.  
  - Output: Grading level (L1, L2, L3).  
- Membership functions:
  - Input parameters ‚Üí trapezoidal/triangular sets (low, average, high).  
  - Output (grade) ‚Üí Gaussian functions.  
- Decision rules mapped estimated values to quality grades.

### 5. Results
- **Model accuracies**:
  - Chlorophyll-a: 89.97%  
  - Moisture Content: 92.8%  
  - Fresh Head Weight: 85.38%  
- Overall **system grading accuracy: 90% (27/30 samples correctly classified)**.  
- Minor misclassifications occurred, mostly biasing towards Grade 2 when the true grade was Grade 3.

## üöÄ Improvements & Future Work
While the system demonstrates strong potential, several enhancements could improve robustness and real-world applicability:

1. **Expand Dataset Size**
   - Current dataset: 56 samples (augmented to 617).  
   - Future: Increase real-world samples across varying lighting, maturity stages, and growing conditions.
2. **Improve Moisture Content Estimation**
   - GP models for moisture showed lower R¬≤ (0.43). Consider incorporating more features and other lettuce quality parameters for better accuracy.
3. **Integrate Deep Learning with Interpretability**
   - Current system prioritizes interpretability (GP + FL).  
   - Hybrid models combining **CNNs for feature extraction** + **GP/FL for decision-making** could balance accuracy and transparency.
4. **Hardware Integration**
   - Automate real-time grading at farms or markets.
   - Comparative analysis of the study compared to the traditional postharvest handling. 
5. **Refine Fuzzy Logic Rules**
   - More nuanced membership functions could better capture borderline cases (L2/L3 misclassifications).  
   - Explore **Type-2 fuzzy logic** for uncertainty handling.
6. **Multi-Crop Adaptation**
   - Extend our approach to other leafy vegetables or fruits by retraining GP models and fuzzy rules.
